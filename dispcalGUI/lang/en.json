As an example, HD video material is usually mastered according to the Rec. 709 standard with either a pure power gamma of around 2.2-2.4 (relative with black output offset of 100%) or Rec. 1886 tone response curve (absolute with black output offset 0%).

For a reasonable quality 3x3 matrix and curves based profile, a few dozen patches can be enough if the display has good additive color mixing properties and linearity. Some professional displays fall into that category. If the highest possible accuracy is desired, a LUT-based profile from around several hundred up to several thousand patches is recommended. The <font weight='bold'>“Auto-optimized”</font> testchart setting automatically takes into account the non-linearities and actual response of the display, and should be used for best quality results.
